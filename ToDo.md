- each frame update, update moving extra points
- one object update, after adding new point
- all objects update, after changing GUI controlls

selection functionality (single, multiple, obejct/s, edges):
- select one object
- select multiple objects by PATH !!! 
- select multiple objects by square selection?
- select multiple edges by PATH !!! 

no cursor or cursor as point with custom radius and color (key shortcut)

multiple layers... better for backdrops... breaks (selection...  )
